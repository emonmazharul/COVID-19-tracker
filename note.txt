I have two node package in this project.One in the client and other in the root folder for backend.
first run the backend server the go to clinet/dist/index.html file and open it you can see my work.
Also if you want to check client development mode go to clinet folder on terminal and run the "npm run dev script".
Thank you Headless team.
